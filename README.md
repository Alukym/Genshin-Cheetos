# Genshin-Cheetos
Based on https://github.com/xsslize/Genshin-Cheat-Base, https://github.com/KnsGoyoLV/GenshinImpact-Base

#### I learnt C and C++ for a few weeks and I am interested in the Genshin impact hack community so I made this and the memory address comes from another cheat engine table I don't know how to search and modify it. If you can help this project with other features feel free to make a pull request or fork this project.
